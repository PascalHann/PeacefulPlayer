# Peaceful Player for Minecraft 1.16 Bukkit

Simple permission based plugin to provide peace to **specific** players that would rather play without monsters. With
this plugin you can prevent monsters from attacking a certain player, prevent a player attacking monsters, or make a
player immune from damage with three simple permissions. No commands or configuration needed.

## Disclaimer
This Plugin was originally developed by [Owen Oclee](https://github.com/owenoclee). I simply updated the list of hostile Mobs to be compatible
with Minecraft Version 1.16

## Usage
Compile the source code yourself and place the JAR file into your server's plugins folder. Use one or more of the permissions below.

## Permissions
* peacefulplayer.pacifier
    - make hostile mobs act as if the permission holder is not there
* peacefulplayer.pacified
    - prevent permission holder from attacking neutral/hostile mobs (incl. other players)
* peacefulplayer.god
    - primitive 'god mode', prevents permission holder from damage (if you truly hate dying!)
